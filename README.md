## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Gulp

### What I learned

During this project I learnt how to use fetch and resolve problem with default using data by cache. I practised flexbox skills. 

### Continued development

I focus now on developing practice skills in Javascript. My future planns are to learn React or Vue framework.

### Useful resources

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/cache - article about cache, which helped me how to resolve the problem with default using the cache. Setting 'no-cache' makes that ' the browser makes a conditional request to the remote server. If the server indicates that the resource has not changed, it will be returned from the cache. Otherwise the resource will be downloaded from the server and the cache will be updated.
